Model to predict the product rating base on product review: Amazon rating machine 

Through the use of AI and machine learning our program returns a predicted rating based on the words within the review inputted into the machine. We used AI and machine learning to train the model with LSTM to predict the ratings of words from inputted reviews based on the data the model received from the dataset it was trained compiling it with an Adam optimizer for its fast and efficient convergence. Some problems faced early on involved problems with accuracy in the predictions with the data which we were able to solve by adjusting the sample and batch size to provide more favorable and accurate results. Some features that we hope to implement in the future are the ability to categorize products to cater more to what the user is searching for within our machine and provide statistics for popular words in each category to make it easier for users to decide on what to input into the machine.
